I am a **junior full-stack developer** looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge.

I've always been interested in computers and gaming. Computers were too expensive growing up in South Africa, so I built my own computer by saving up to buy one compenent at a time - it took me 2 years until I had all the parts.

I finished high school with distinctions in Maths and IT. I went on to study Computer Engineering. After a year I changed universities and pursued philosophy instead. Now I'm in London and fascinated by tech. Makers has been exactly what I needed.
